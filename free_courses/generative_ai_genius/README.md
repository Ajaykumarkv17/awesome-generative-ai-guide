# About the Course:

Welcome to Generative AI Genius! This 20-day introductory course is designed to help you break into generative AI.  This course is designed for today's busy individuals who crave concise, succinct information. 

**Generative AI Genius the first AI course based on short videos or reels!** 

If you've been wanting to learn about generative AI, understand the buzzwords, and not feel lost, you're in the right place. You can spend as little as 2-5 minutes a day learning generative AI in a way that builds on the knowledge gained from previous videos, giving you a comprehensive mind-map of the field. 

I see each of you as one of the following types of learners:

**1. The Busy Bee** 

If you're short on time but want to grasp generative AI concepts, my videos/reels are perfect for you. Just dedicate 2-5 minutes daily, and you'll stay informed without needing to look up extra material. Concepts will build on each other, keeping you perfectly in the loop.

**2. The Curious Learner**

If you liked the the videos but want to explore the concepts further, I've handpicked some great resources for you. These usually take about 20-30 minutes and will help you grasp the material more deeply. They'll also improve your understanding of related concepts, making everything more cohesive.

**3. The Hands-On Enthusiast**

If you're someone with a coding background who prefers hands-on learning, I'll be sharing few mini-project resources throughout the course. These projects will allow you to put the concepts into practice, using high-quality tutorials and videos.

üö®**NOTE: The videos stand alone, so you can understand the concepts without needing to read the additional resources‚Äîthey're just there to aid your understanding.**

# What you'll Learn
This course heavily focuses on applied generative AI to help you get started with building applications. Here's an overview of the topics we'll cover, and if you don't understand some of these, don't worry‚Äîyou'll get enough background during the course:

- Basics of Generative AI and Large Language Models (LLMs)
- Prompting Techniques
- Building Generative AI Applications (RAG)
- Basics of Fine-Tuning
- Common Challenges and Evaluation
- Future Trends in Generative AI

Please note that this course emphasizes understanding applied concepts and building applications using generative AI. It won't teach you to build generative AI models, which requires a much more comprehensive course structure and a lot of prerequisites. If someone tells you otherwise, I'd double-check their credentials üôÇ

# What are the Prerequisites?

Honestly, this is a course I want people from all backgrounds to engage with and take away valuable insights at their preferred level of understanding. However, the amount of information you can absorb may vary depending on your background.

Here‚Äôs what it offers to individuals with different backgrounds:

### 1. No Computer Science (CS) Background

The course may introduce terms that are new to you and some parts might be challenging. However, you'll still gain a high-level overview of the field and understand key concepts. Based on my experience, you should be able to grasp about 60-80% of the content. It's still worth your 2-5 minutes daily, right?

### 2. CS Background, Limited Machine Learning (ML) Experience

If you're a software engineer or tech enthusiast, you probably have a basic understanding of ML concepts such as training and evaluation. You should be able to follow the course from beginning to end and complete a few projects in generative AI. My primary audience consists of individuals like you who are seeking to enter the field. This course can also serve as your entry into building generative AI projects and transitioning to a career as a generative AI engineer.

### 3. ML Background

If you have experience in ML but are new to NLP or LLMs, the main advantage for you will be the mini-projects and supplementary reading materials. These resources should provide you with enough knowledge to begin implementing your own projects and also enable you to start studying generative AI research and understand its broader context.
